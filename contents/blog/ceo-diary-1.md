_We are open source_ is [literally our top value](../handbook/company/values)... and what better way to be transparent than to share a diary!

# Late mover advantage

Product analytics is a busy space. It reminds me of the _front_ entrance to Liverpool Street station in London:

![Liverpool Street Front Entrance - lots of people](../images/blog/CEO-diary-1/liverpool-st-station.jpg)

PostHog Fact: Tim (my cofounder) incorrectly believes this is the side entrance - it's one of our greatest disagreements.

There are tons of competitors in product analytics, and they've pretty much all got 300+ person teams, around $100M or more in funding, and years and years of headstart. Yet, we're totally confident we can win as a late mover.

A losing strategy for late movers:

1. We'll hire lots of salespeople
2. We'll build features that the salespeople need to sell to big companies, which will make our product feel the same as everyone else's
3. Since the product is built for selling and not using, it'll be annoying to use
4. We will churn lots of customers, and thus will put even more energy into selling. Go back to step 1.

A winning strategy for late movers:

1. We'll double down investing in our open source project
2. It gets more and more popular so developers at big companies will find and deploy us
3. Since the product is good, it'll roll out across the rest of the company
4. Big companies end up happily paying for the valuable product they're using. Go back to step 1.

# So what are we doing about the above?

PostHog started off as an open source project. We started getting emails like this one, which is from a 30k employee corporate that you'll have heard of:

![An email from a potential customer saying they have extreme interest](../images/blog/CEO-diary-1/extreme-interest.jpg)

We felt we provided a _worse_ experience to paying customers like this than to free users. Whoah, did we just say that?!

Larger companies have a wider range of stakeholders and generally more users on the platform. They have a broader range of users than just developers, and these other user profiles (like product managers or growth managers) (i) tend to want more detailed analytics views (ii) don't have the same willingness to tolerate bugs.

We wanted to try out selling to companies like this so we could complete the open core business model. We would then use this to double down on improvements to our free project, knowing we could delight paid customers when they come our way.

Thus we decided to get [Five Reference Customers](../handbook/strategy/strategy), despite having >100 subscribers (on top of thousands of open source deployments). This means customers who are (i) genuinely delighted (ii) using PostHog meaningfully (iii) paying full price.

From this exercise, we learned we had to level up our UX around funnels. So we [Nailed Funnels](new-vp-nailing-funnels). Next up, we're working on [Nailing Diagnosis](../handbook/strategy/roadmap). This is particularly cool as we're starting to see how our broad approach (with analytics, session recording and feature flags), uniquely lets users visualize their funnels, understand _why_ funnel performance is bad, and release changes to safely improve it.

# A board meeting happened

This mainly focused on what our reference customers have in common.

They appeared to be from a wide range of industries, so we thought about the _Needs_ and the _Haves_ they've got in common. 

This is what we're seeing:

# What's next

We're going to as quickly as possible make sure we can get more like the above. There are two main things:

1. Immediately, [we updated the product positioning on the homepage](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1810). We're working on a simpler, cleaner design, but we wanted to make a handful of changes immediately.
1. We're launching some marketing to accelerate promoting PostHog to teams that feel like the above to see just how quickly we can get more like this through the process. The test is can we do this without building any more paid features.

Anyway, that's me done for today and you should get back to work. Have a lovely day :)
